--Running time of the 8000 values is 51.1 Seconds

lg(T(N)) = 3 lg N + lg a

T(N) = running time for a givien size
N = size of the set
a = constant

this is represented as 

T(N) = aN^3 (N^3 is N cubed) 

Given 8000 take 51.1 Seconds

T(8000) = 51.1 = a8000^3
therefore
a = 51.1 / 8000^3
a = 0.0000000000998
a = 9.98e-11

T(8000) = 51.0976 = 9.98e-11 * 8000^3

so since a is te constant

T(16000) = 408.7808 =  9.98e-11 * 16000^3

JS
t = 9.98e-11 * Math.pow(16000,3)
